# Failed exfiltration

At first glance, the document is empty, but if we take a closer look, we can see that it contains a bunch of spaces and tabs.

After replacing tabs with `-` and spaces with `.`, we get:

`.---- -. ...- .---- ... .---- -... .-.. .---- ..-. .-.. ....- --.`

This looks like a morse code.

After translating the morse code to English, we get the flag:

`1NV1S1BL1FL4G`
