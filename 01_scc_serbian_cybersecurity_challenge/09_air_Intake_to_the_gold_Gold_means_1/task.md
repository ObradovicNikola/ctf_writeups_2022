### Mission brief

Steganography: The root "steganos" comes from the Greek "hidden", and "graph" from "to write". Literally, this means "hidden writing". The main purpose is to hide a secret inside something that is not a secret, so let's see how it works.

Stegonography has been used for centuries, but these days, hackers and the IT world have brought a digital meaning to the word. Since steganography is the tale of Man and Machine, we decided to offer you a picture that shows a similar story. Watch as Max Verstappen, the RB7, and Alpine Ski Racer Aksel Lund Svindal meet up for a showdown in Kitzb√ºhel as they take on the famous Streif. See the story [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkwoK0EfKdc). If the best of motorsport met the best of winter sports, how do you compare Formula 1 at the Red Bull Ring in Austria and the World Cup downhill on the Streif? Speed, g-forces, track record, or height differences - there are plenty of similarities...

### Instructions

This picture describes the essence of competition and the beauty of Austria, the home of Red Bull. Are you clever enough to discover the flag hidden in this shot?
