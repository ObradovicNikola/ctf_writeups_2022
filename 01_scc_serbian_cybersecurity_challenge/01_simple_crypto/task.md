# Simple crypto

## Description and resources

### Mission brief

You've managed to eavesdrop on an encrypted communication channel and record the following cyphertext: 

```
4e54eac041dd3cccca8c4f62ff8b4e6b59a7129cb6cbcb4621c86a83f712914d

```

### Instructions

You suspect that the data is encoded and encrypted with well-known AND frequently used algorithms. You also suspect that the key consists of the following 8-character word CHALENGE (Note: the typo is intentional!) Can you decode and decrypt the cyphertext and find the flag inside the plaintext?
