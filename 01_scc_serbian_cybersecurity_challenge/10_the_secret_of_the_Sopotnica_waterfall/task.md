# The secret of the Sopotnica waterfall

## Description and resources

### Mission brief

The Sopotnica Waterfalls, situated on the slopes of the Jadovnik mountain in Southwestern Serbia, are caused by а vertical drop in the course of the river Sopotnica as it races its way to the mountain’s base. The river itself is sourced from several springs, some permanent and some intermittent; after a stretch where all water follows the same course, it branches again, creating separate watercourses racing down the mountain’s sides, each branch with its own waterfalls. As you approach the falls on the Sopotnica river, you will see absolutely no hint of the splendid natural treasure you are about to discover. On the narrow dirt road, which can only be traversed on foot, you will hear the mighty hum of the Sopotnica beckoning you, eager to present to its waterfalls in all their glory. This postcard from Sopotnica, in addition to the natural beauty it depicts, also hides another secret. Find it, if you can...
